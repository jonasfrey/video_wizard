[0:00]  Agents are the new apps.
  [0.70 - 1.10] Agents
  [1.10 - 1.44] are
  [1.44 - 2.14] the
  [2.14 - 2.34] new
  [2.34 - 2.66] apps.

[0:03]  And we expect someday for there to be thousands of agents available.
  [3.86 - 4.26] And
  [4.26 - 4.40] we
  [4.40 - 4.64] expect
  [4.64 - 5.14] someday
  [5.14 - 5.58] for
  [5.58 - 5.72] there
  [5.72 - 5.88] to
  [5.88 - 5.98] be
  [5.98 - 6.54] thousands
  [6.54 - 6.80] of
  [6.80 - 7.06] agents
  [7.06 - 7.46] available.

[0:07]  We want a thousand agents to bloom.
  [7.64 - 7.70] We
  [7.70 - 7.88] want
  [7.88 - 8.06] a
  [8.06 - 8.56] thousand
  [8.56 - 8.92] agents
  [8.92 - 9.10] to
  [9.10 - 9.30] bloom.

[0:09]  So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions
  [9.70 - 9.86] So
  [9.86 - 9.96] I
  [9.96 - 10.04] think
  [10.04 - 10.18] we're
  [10.18 - 10.28] going
  [10.28 - 10.30] to
  [10.30 - 10.42] live
  [10.42 - 10.52] in
  [10.52 - 10.56] a
  [10.56 - 10.76] world
  [10.76 - 10.92] where
  [10.92 - 11.02] there
  [11.02 - 11.08] are
  [11.08 - 11.18] going
  [11.18 - 11.22] to
  [11.22 - 11.32] be
  [11.32 - 12.10] hundreds
  [12.10 - 12.30] of
  [12.30 - 12.54] millions

[0:12]  of billions of different AI agents.
  [12.54 - 12.80] of
  [12.80 - 13.32] billions
  [13.32 - 13.60] of
  [13.60 - 13.86] different
  [13.86 - 14.00] AI
  [14.00 - 14.48] agents.

[0:15]  Eventually, probably more AI agents than there are people in the world.
  [15.06 - 15.46] Eventually,
  [15.48 - 15.78] probably
  [15.78 - 16.00] more
  [16.00 - 16.26] AI
  [16.26 - 16.70] agents
  [16.70 - 16.92] than
  [16.92 - 17.02] there
  [17.02 - 17.12] are
  [17.12 - 17.42] people
  [17.42 - 17.56] in
  [17.56 - 17.64] the
  [17.64 - 17.94] world.

[0:18]  For the very first time, this is going to be an industry of skills.
  [18.16 - 18.24] For
  [18.24 - 18.30] the
  [18.30 - 18.42] very
  [18.42 - 18.66] first
  [18.66 - 18.86] time,
  [18.92 - 19.04] this
  [19.04 - 19.12] is
  [19.12 - 19.26] going
  [19.26 - 19.30] to
  [19.30 - 19.40] be
  [19.40 - 19.54] an
  [19.54 - 20.34] industry
  [20.34 - 20.66] of
  [20.66 - 21.02] skills.

[0:21]  And you capture that phrase and you call it agents.
  [21.94 - 22.12] And
  [22.12 - 22.36] you
  [22.36 - 22.80] capture
  [22.80 - 23.08] that
  [23.08 - 24.32] phrase
  [24.32 - 24.66] and
  [24.66 - 24.80] you
  [24.80 - 25.86] call
  [25.86 - 26.00] it
  [26.00 - 26.38] agents.

[0:26]  But it's going to be for the very first time agents sitting on top of tools.
  [26.38 - 26.74] But
  [26.74 - 26.88] it's
  [26.88 - 26.98] going
  [26.98 - 27.08] to
  [27.08 - 27.16] be
  [27.16 - 27.30] for
  [27.30 - 27.40] the
  [27.40 - 27.54] very
  [27.54 - 27.80] first
  [27.80 - 28.08] time
  [28.08 - 28.78] agents
  [28.78 - 29.58] sitting
  [29.58 - 29.76] on
  [29.76 - 29.98] top
  [29.98 - 30.32] of
  [30.32 - 30.80] tools.

[0:31]  If you're here, it's probably because you've been hearing a lot about AI agents lately.
  [31.30 - 31.40] If
  [31.40 - 31.66] you're
  [31.66 - 31.96] here,
  [32.20 - 32.46] it's
  [32.46 - 32.86] probably
  [32.86 - 33.20] because
  [33.20 - 33.54] you've
  [33.54 - 33.70] been
  [33.70 - 33.96] hearing
  [33.96 - 34.18] a
  [34.18 - 34.46] lot
  [34.46 - 35.02] about
  [35.02 - 35.26] AI
  [35.26 - 35.74] agents
  [35.74 - 36.08] lately.

[0:36]  Maybe you've even checked out some other videos that go way too technical.
  [36.54 - 36.98] Maybe
  [36.98 - 37.44] you've
  [37.44 - 37.62] even
  [37.62 - 37.80] checked
  [37.80 - 37.98] out
  [37.98 - 38.14] some
  [38.14 - 38.32] other
  [38.32 - 38.66] videos
  [38.66 - 38.96] that
  [38.96 - 39.10] go
  [39.10 - 39.62] way
  [39.62 - 40.04] too
  [40.04 - 40.48] technical.

[0:40]  And you thought, why don't you explain this to me like I'm five?
  [40.90 - 40.96] And
  [40.96 - 41.04] you
  [41.04 - 41.32] thought,
  [41.58 - 41.98] why
  [41.98 - 42.10] don't
  [42.10 - 42.22] you
  [42.22 - 42.54] explain
  [42.54 - 42.74] this
  [42.74 - 42.80] to
  [42.80 - 42.88] me
  [42.88 - 43.04] like
  [43.04 - 43.22] I'm
  [43.22 - 43.40] five?

[0:43]  Well, guess what?
  [43.98 - 44.14] Well,
  [44.36 - 44.74] guess
  [44.74 - 45.08] what?

[0:45]  That's exactly what I'm going to do.
  [45.44 - 45.88] That's
  [45.88 - 46.20] exactly
  [46.20 - 46.46] what
  [46.46 - 46.60] I'm
  [46.60 - 46.70] going
  [46.70 - 46.88] to
  [46.88 - 47.06] do.

[0:47]  I'm going to give you the most straightforward real world explanation of what an AI agent is.
  [47.66 - 47.88] I'm
  [47.88 - 48.02] going
  [48.02 - 48.20] to
  [48.20 - 48.42] give
  [48.42 - 48.66] you
  [48.66 - 49.18] the
  [49.18 - 49.70] most
  [49.70 - 50.32] straightforward
  [50.32 - 51.08] real
  [51.08 - 51.30] world
  [51.30 - 51.82] explanation
  [51.82 - 52.26] of
  [52.26 - 52.56] what
  [52.56 - 52.88] an
  [52.88 - 53.22] AI
  [53.22 - 53.80] agent
  [53.80 - 54.22] is.

[0:58]  So what is it?
  [58.50 - 59.08] So
  [59.08 - 59.26] what
  [59.26 - 59.40] is
  [59.40 - 59.58] it?

[1:00]  You probably already know that AI stands for artificial intelligence.
  [60.02 - 60.24] You
  [60.24 - 60.62] probably
  [60.62 - 60.98] already
  [60.98 - 61.22] know
  [61.22 - 61.50] that
  [61.50 - 61.70] AI
  [61.70 - 62.14] stands
  [62.14 - 62.40] for
  [62.40 - 62.84] artificial
  [62.84 - 63.44] intelligence.

[1:03]  But here's where it gets interesting.
  [63.98 - 64.16] But
  [64.16 - 64.70] here's
  [64.70 - 64.84] where
  [64.84 - 64.98] it
  [64.98 - 65.06] gets
  [65.06 - 65.54] interesting.

[1:06]  AI by itself is like raw brain power.
  [66.12 - 66.38] AI
  [66.38 - 66.72] by
  [66.72 - 67.14] itself
  [67.14 - 67.68] is
  [67.68 - 67.90] like
  [67.90 - 68.26] raw
  [68.26 - 68.76] brain
  [68.76 - 69.04] power.

[1:09]  It's got all this potential, but it's not really useful until you give it a job.
  [69.46 - 69.72] It's
  [69.72 - 69.84] got
  [69.84 - 70.06] all
  [70.06 - 70.22] this
  [70.22 - 70.68] potential,
  [71.00 - 71.14] but
  [71.14 - 71.34] it's
  [71.34 - 71.46] not
  [71.46 - 71.74] really
  [71.74 - 72.18] useful
  [72.18 - 72.52] until
  [72.52 - 72.70] you
  [72.70 - 72.84] give
  [72.84 - 72.96] it
  [72.96 - 73.00] a
  [73.00 - 73.28] job.

[1:13]  Enter the AI agent.
  [73.70 - 73.98] Enter
  [73.98 - 74.38] the
  [74.38 - 74.68] AI
  [74.68 - 75.06] agent.

[1:15]  Think of AI as the genius with a million ideas and the AI agent is the one who actually gets stuff done.
  [75.68 - 75.90] Think
  [75.90 - 76.08] of
  [76.08 - 76.38] AI
  [76.38 - 76.74] as
  [76.74 - 76.88] the
  [76.88 - 77.34] genius
  [77.34 - 77.68] with
  [77.68 - 77.76] a
  [77.76 - 78.04] million
  [78.04 - 78.50] ideas
  [78.50 - 78.96] and
  [78.96 - 79.08] the
  [79.08 - 79.40] AI
  [79.40 - 79.84] agent
  [79.84 - 80.12] is
  [80.12 - 80.26] the
  [80.26 - 80.42] one
  [80.42 - 80.76] who
  [80.76 - 81.34] actually
  [81.34 - 81.60] gets
  [81.60 - 81.94] stuff
  [81.94 - 82.24] done.

[1:22]  While AI is all about smarts, an AI agent is the practical hands-on version.
  [82.24 - 83.18] While
  [83.18 - 83.44] AI
  [83.44 - 83.88] is
  [83.88 - 84.10] all
  [84.10 - 84.34] about
  [84.34 - 85.06] smarts,
  [85.28 - 85.44] an
  [85.44 - 85.72] AI
  [85.72 - 86.16] agent
  [86.16 - 86.44] is
  [86.44 - 86.60] the
  [86.60 - 87.08] practical
  [87.08 - 87.58] hands
  [87.58 - 87.82] -on
  [87.82 - 88.22] version.

[1:28]  It's like giving that genius a task and saying, okay, now go do something useful with all that brain power.
  [88.58 - 89.02] It's
  [89.02 - 89.12] like
  [89.12 - 89.42] giving
  [89.42 - 89.88] that
  [89.88 - 90.30] genius
  [90.30 - 90.58] a
  [90.58 - 90.88] task
  [90.88 - 91.08] and
  [91.08 - 91.34] saying,
  [91.76 - 91.96] okay,
  [92.52 - 92.70] now
  [92.70 - 92.86] go
  [92.86 - 93.02] do
  [93.02 - 93.28] something
  [93.28 - 93.66] useful
  [93.66 - 93.92] with
  [93.92 - 94.04] all
  [94.04 - 94.20] that
  [94.20 - 94.40] brain
  [94.40 - 94.66] power.

[1:35]  The AI agent takes the intelligence of AI and turns it into action,
  [95.28 - 95.50] The
  [95.50 - 95.84] AI
  [95.84 - 96.38] agent
  [96.38 - 96.68] takes
  [96.68 - 96.88] the
  [96.88 - 97.30] intelligence
  [97.30 - 97.52] of
  [97.52 - 97.78] AI
  [97.78 - 98.22] and
  [98.22 - 98.50] turns
  [98.50 - 98.68] it
  [98.68 - 98.88] into
  [98.88 - 99.28] action,

[1:39]  whether it's answering your questions, automating your work, or handling your to-do list.
  [99.58 - 99.98] whether
  [99.98 - 100.16] it's
  [100.16 - 100.44] answering
  [100.44 - 100.60] your
  [100.60 - 100.94] questions,
  [101.62 - 101.92] automating
  [101.92 - 102.14] your
  [102.14 - 102.38] work,
  [102.90 - 103.00] or
  [103.00 - 103.44] handling
  [103.44 - 103.90] your
  [103.90 - 104.12] to
  [104.12 - 104.38] -do
  [104.38 - 104.78] list.

[1:45]  It's the difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.
  [105.32 - 105.88] It's
  [105.88 - 105.96] the
  [105.96 - 106.24] difference
  [106.24 - 106.70] between
  [106.70 - 107.04] knowing
  [107.04 - 107.34] how
  [107.34 - 107.60] to
  [107.60 - 108.08] do
  [108.08 - 108.48] something
  [108.48 - 108.64] and
  [108.64 - 108.98] actually
  [108.98 - 109.72] doing
  [109.72 - 109.88] it.

[1:50]  So while AI is the brains, the AI agent is the one rolling up its sleeves and making things happen.
  [110.60 - 110.90] So
  [110.90 - 111.20] while
  [111.20 - 111.50] AI
  [111.50 - 111.90] is
  [111.90 - 112.02] the
  [112.02 - 112.36] brains,
  [112.78 - 112.88] the
  [112.88 - 113.26] AI
  [113.26 - 113.72] agent
  [113.72 - 114.00] is
  [114.00 - 114.18] the
  [114.18 - 114.48] one
  [114.48 - 114.94] rolling
  [114.94 - 115.12] up
  [115.12 - 115.28] its
  [115.28 - 115.60] sleeves
  [115.60 - 116.24] and
  [116.24 - 116.58] making
  [116.58 - 117.10] things
  [117.10 - 117.46] happen.

[1:58]  Here is the one two three of AI agents.
  [118.26 - 118.64] Here
  [118.64 - 118.86] is
  [118.86 - 118.96] the
  [118.96 - 119.20] one
  [119.20 - 119.40] two
  [119.40 - 119.72] three
  [119.72 - 120.06] of
  [120.06 - 120.34] AI
  [120.34 - 120.84] agents.

[2:01]  Number one, they understand.
  [121.46 - 121.58] Number
  [121.58 - 121.90] one,
  [122.16 - 122.40] they
  [122.40 - 122.94] understand.

[2:03]  AI agents listen to what you're asking or needing.
  [123.52 - 123.70] AI
  [123.70 - 124.12] agents
  [124.12 - 124.36] listen
  [124.36 - 124.62] to
  [124.62 - 124.92] what
  [124.92 - 125.16] you're
  [125.16 - 125.60] asking
  [125.60 - 125.90] or
  [125.90 - 126.18] needing.

[2:06]  Number two, they think.
  [126.92 - 127.10] Number
  [127.10 - 127.40] two,
  [127.74 - 127.98] they
  [127.98 - 128.28] think.

[2:08]  They process this information and figure out the best way to help you.
  [128.88 - 129.14] They
  [129.14 - 129.54] process
  [129.54 - 129.82] this
  [129.82 - 130.30] information
  [130.30 - 130.56] and
  [130.56 - 130.82] figure
  [130.82 - 131.00] out
  [131.00 - 131.26] the
  [131.26 - 131.56] best
  [131.56 - 131.76] way
  [131.76 - 132.14] to
  [132.14 - 132.34] help
  [132.34 - 132.56] you.

[2:13]  And number three, they act.
  [133.14 - 133.34] And
  [133.34 - 133.54] number
  [133.54 - 133.88] three,
  [134.34 - 134.48] they
  [134.48 - 134.80] act.

[2:14]  They don't.
  [134.80 - 134.90] They
  [134.90 - 134.90] don't.

[2:15]  Finally, they deliver what you need, whether it's an answer, a solution, or help completing a task.
  [135.20 - 135.72] Finally,
  [135.96 - 136.10] they
  [136.10 - 136.42] deliver
  [136.42 - 136.70] what
  [136.70 - 136.88] you
  [136.88 - 137.16] need,
  [137.40 - 137.66] whether
  [137.66 - 137.82] it's
  [137.82 - 137.90] an
  [137.90 - 138.22] answer,
  [138.64 - 138.72] a
  [138.72 - 139.24] solution,
  [139.56 - 139.84] or
  [139.84 - 140.18] help
  [140.18 - 140.96] completing
  [140.96 - 141.28] a
  [141.28 - 141.60] task.

[2:22]  Now how do they work?
  [142.40 - 142.50] Now
  [142.50 - 142.64] how
  [142.64 - 142.72] do
  [142.72 - 142.82] they
  [142.82 - 143.04] work?

[2:23]  Imagine your parents are heading out for the evening and leaving the babysitter in charge.
  [143.68 - 144.00] Imagine
  [144.00 - 144.18] your
  [144.18 - 144.50] parents
  [144.50 - 144.76] are
  [144.76 - 145.12] heading
  [145.12 - 145.30] out
  [145.30 - 145.54] for
  [145.54 - 145.82] the
  [145.82 - 146.14] evening
  [146.14 - 146.30] and
  [146.30 - 146.58] leaving
  [146.58 - 146.86] the
  [146.86 - 147.36] babysitter
  [147.36 - 147.54] in
  [147.54 - 147.86] charge.

[2:28]  Remember, you're only five.
  [148.36 - 148.68] Remember,
  [148.88 - 148.94] you're
  [148.94 - 149.06] only
  [149.06 - 149.40] five.

[2:30]  They don't just walk out the door.
  [150.28 - 150.48] They
  [150.48 - 150.90] don't
  [150.90 - 151.14] just
  [151.14 - 151.36] walk
  [151.36 - 151.56] out
  [151.56 - 151.70] the
  [151.70 - 151.96] door.

[2:32]  They give them instructions.
  [152.42 - 152.52] They
  [152.52 - 152.74] give
  [152.74 - 153.02] them
  [153.02 - 153.74] instructions.

[2:34]  What time you need to go to bed.
  [154.20 - 154.40] What
  [154.40 - 154.62] time
  [154.62 - 154.80] you
  [154.80 - 154.92] need
  [154.92 - 155.06] to
  [155.06 - 155.18] go
  [155.18 - 155.28] to
  [155.28 - 155.46] bed.

[2:36]  What you can have for a snack.
  [156.32 - 156.84] What
  [156.84 - 157.00] you
  [157.00 - 157.26] can
  [157.26 - 157.62] have
  [157.62 - 157.90] for
  [157.90 - 158.10] a
  [158.10 - 158.26] snack.

[2:38]  And what to do in case of an emergency.
  [158.90 - 159.02] And
  [159.02 - 159.18] what
  [159.18 - 159.34] to
  [159.34 - 159.54] do
  [159.54 - 159.88] in
  [159.88 - 160.20] case
  [160.20 - 160.46] of
  [160.46 - 160.58] an
  [160.58 - 161.04] emergency.

[2:41]  That's exactly how AI agents are trained.
  [161.68 - 161.96] That's
  [161.96 - 162.40] exactly
  [162.40 - 162.72] how
  [162.72 - 163.00] AI
  [163.00 - 163.40] agents
  [163.40 - 163.56] are
  [163.56 - 163.98] trained.

[2:43]  Developers provide these agents with detailed instructions using data.
  [163.98 - 165.48] Developers
  [165.48 - 165.86] provide
  [165.86 - 166.26] these
  [166.26 - 166.62] agents
  [166.62 - 166.90] with
  [166.90 - 167.36] detailed
  [167.36 - 167.98] instructions
  [167.98 - 168.38] using
  [168.38 - 168.74] data.

[2:49]  So they know exactly how to respond in different situations.
  [169.24 - 169.46] So
  [169.46 - 169.70] they
  [169.70 - 170.02] know
  [170.02 - 170.66] exactly
  [170.66 - 171.10] how
  [171.10 - 171.28] to
  [171.28 - 171.68] respond
  [171.68 - 172.14] in
  [172.14 - 172.50] different
  [172.50 - 173.36] situations.

[2:54]  Some agents come pre-programmed with basic instructions, like a babysitter who's already experienced.
  [174.22 - 174.66] Some
  [174.66 - 175.12] agents
  [175.12 - 175.56] come
  [175.56 - 175.86] pre
  [175.86 - 176.54] -programmed
  [176.54 - 176.76] with
  [176.76 - 177.10] basic
  [177.10 - 177.74] instructions,
  [178.14 - 178.34] like
  [178.34 - 178.46] a
  [178.46 - 178.98] babysitter
  [178.98 - 179.30] who's
  [179.30 - 179.50] already
  [179.50 - 180.24] experienced.

[3:01]  Others can be customized to fit your needs, like giving the babysitter special rules for kids.
  [181.64 - 182.02] Others
  [182.02 - 182.30] can
  [182.30 - 182.44] be
  [182.44 - 183.02] customized
  [183.02 - 183.42] to
  [183.42 - 183.64] fit
  [183.64 - 183.88] your
  [183.88 - 184.30] needs,
  [184.74 - 184.88] like
  [184.88 - 185.12] giving
  [185.12 - 185.28] the
  [185.28 - 185.86] babysitter
  [185.86 - 186.64] special
  [186.64 - 187.02] rules
  [187.02 - 187.26] for
  [187.26 - 187.56] kids.

[3:08]  Once set up, these AI agents handle tasks just as smoothly as a well-informed babysitter,
  [188.34 - 188.94] Once
  [188.94 - 189.22] set
  [189.22 - 189.38] up,
  [189.68 - 189.88] these
  [189.88 - 190.20] AI
  [190.20 - 190.64] agents
  [190.64 - 191.00] handle
  [191.00 - 191.44] tasks
  [191.44 - 192.04] just
  [192.04 - 192.26] as
  [192.26 - 192.72] smoothly
  [192.72 - 193.04] as
  [193.04 - 193.18] a
  [193.18 - 193.40] well
  [193.40 - 193.98] -informed
  [193.98 - 194.58] babysitter,

[3:15]  freeing you up to focus on other things.
  [195.10 - 195.56] freeing
  [195.56 - 195.82] you
  [195.82 - 196.36] up
  [196.36 - 196.52] to
  [196.52 - 196.84] focus
  [196.84 - 197.10] on
  [197.10 - 197.56] other
  [197.56 - 198.06] things.

[3:18]  So what does an AI agent actually look like?
  [198.44 - 198.62] So
  [198.62 - 198.74] what
  [198.74 - 198.86] does
  [198.86 - 198.98] an
  [198.98 - 199.18] AI
  [199.18 - 199.56] agent
  [199.56 - 199.90] actually
  [199.90 - 200.12] look
  [200.12 - 200.36] like?

[3:20]  When we talk about what an AI agent looks like, it's helpful to think of it as a combination of two things.
  [200.76 - 201.16] When
  [201.16 - 201.28] we
  [201.28 - 201.48] talk
  [201.48 - 201.78] about
  [201.78 - 202.02] what
  [202.02 - 202.26] an
  [202.26 - 202.50] AI
  [202.50 - 202.92] agent
  [202.92 - 203.12] looks
  [203.12 - 203.48] like,
  [203.72 - 203.94] it's
  [203.94 - 204.16] helpful
  [204.16 - 204.60] to
  [204.60 - 204.86] think
  [204.86 - 205.02] of
  [205.02 - 205.14] it
  [205.14 - 205.34] as
  [205.34 - 205.48] a
  [205.48 - 206.08] combination
  [206.08 - 206.36] of
  [206.36 - 206.54] two
  [206.54 - 206.90] things.

[3:27]  An interface and a workflow.
  [207.74 - 207.96] An
  [207.96 - 208.48] interface
  [208.48 - 209.48] and
  [209.48 - 209.62] a
  [209.62 - 210.00] workflow.

[3:30]  The interface is how you interact with the AI agent.
  [210.46 - 210.90] The
  [210.90 - 211.44] interface
  [211.44 - 211.82] is
  [211.82 - 212.06] how
  [212.06 - 212.32] you
  [212.32 - 212.78] interact
  [212.78 - 213.12] with
  [213.12 - 213.28] the
  [213.28 - 213.58] AI
  [213.58 - 214.06] agent.

[3:34]  Maybe through a chat window, a voice assistant, or even a button on a website.
  [214.06 - 214.74] Maybe
  [214.74 - 215.08] through
  [215.08 - 215.24] a
  [215.24 - 215.42] chat
  [215.42 - 215.98] window,
  [216.64 - 216.72] a
  [216.72 - 216.96] voice
  [216.96 - 217.54] assistant,
  [217.92 - 218.06] or
  [218.06 - 218.38] even
  [218.38 - 218.58] a
  [218.58 - 218.94] button
  [218.94 - 219.28] on
  [219.28 - 219.36] a
  [219.36 - 219.80] website.

[3:40]  But behind that interface is where the real magic happens, and that's the workflow.
  [220.34 - 220.72] But
  [220.72 - 221.20] behind
  [221.20 - 221.52] that
  [221.52 - 222.00] interface
  [222.00 - 222.32] is
  [222.32 - 222.60] where
  [222.60 - 222.94] the
  [222.94 - 223.26] real
  [223.26 - 223.58] magic
  [223.58 - 224.06] happens,
  [224.48 - 224.60] and
  [224.60 - 225.12] that's
  [225.12 - 225.30] the
  [225.30 - 225.72] workflow.

[3:47]  Imagine a flow chart.
  [227.04 - 227.48] Imagine
  [227.48 - 227.92] a
  [227.92 - 228.28] flow
  [228.28 - 228.58] chart.

[3:49]  You ask the AI agent a question or give it a command through the interface.
  [229.16 - 229.32] You
  [229.32 - 229.74] ask
  [229.74 - 230.00] the
  [230.00 - 230.30] AI
  [230.30 - 230.72] agent
  [230.72 - 230.92] a
  [230.92 - 231.36] question
  [231.36 - 231.74] or
  [231.74 - 231.96] give
  [231.96 - 232.18] it
  [232.18 - 232.44] a
  [232.44 - 232.84] command
  [232.84 - 233.44] through
  [233.44 - 233.62] the
  [233.62 - 234.08] interface.

[3:54]  That's the starting point.
  [234.68 - 235.10] That's
  [235.10 - 235.18] the
  [235.18 - 235.48] starting
  [235.48 - 235.80] point.

[3:56]  From there, the AI agent follows a series of steps or nodes in a workflow.
  [236.80 - 237.10] From
  [237.10 - 237.40] there,
  [237.68 - 237.74] the
  [237.74 - 238.06] AI
  [238.06 - 238.50] agent
  [238.50 - 238.80] follows
  [238.80 - 239.10] a
  [239.10 - 239.54] series
  [239.54 - 239.74] of
  [239.74 - 240.04] steps
  [240.04 - 240.64] or
  [240.64 - 241.14] nodes
  [241.14 - 242.02] in
  [242.02 - 242.24] a
  [242.24 - 242.82] workflow.

[4:03]  These nodes could involve accessing information from a database,
  [243.60 - 243.92] These
  [243.92 - 244.40] nodes
  [244.40 - 245.06] could
  [245.06 - 245.42] involve
  [245.42 - 245.90] accessing
  [245.90 - 246.50] information
  [246.50 - 246.80] from
  [246.80 - 247.12] a
  [247.12 - 247.50] database,

[4:08]  making a decision based on what it finds, or even performing a task like sending an email.
  [248.16 - 248.60] making
  [248.60 - 248.72] a
  [248.72 - 249.06] decision
  [249.06 - 249.40] based
  [249.40 - 249.58] on
  [249.58 - 249.88] what
  [249.88 - 250.04] it
  [250.04 - 250.48] finds,
  [250.92 - 251.04] or
  [251.04 - 251.36] even
  [251.36 - 251.88] performing
  [251.88 - 252.14] a
  [252.14 - 252.56] task
  [252.56 - 252.98] like
  [252.98 - 253.28] sending
  [253.28 - 253.42] an
  [253.42 - 253.76] email.

[4:14]  The nodes in this workflow might change depending on what you ask or what the AI agent needs to do next.
  [254.66 - 254.80] The
  [254.80 - 255.06] nodes
  [255.06 - 255.26] in
  [255.26 - 255.40] this
  [255.40 - 255.62] workflow
  [255.62 - 256.10] might
  [256.10 - 256.44] change
  [256.44 - 256.84] depending
  [256.84 - 257.08] on
  [257.08 - 257.30] what
  [257.30 - 257.48] you
  [257.48 - 257.92] ask
  [257.92 - 258.30] or
  [258.30 - 258.48] what
  [258.48 - 258.68] the
  [258.68 - 258.94] AI
  [258.94 - 259.44] agent
  [259.44 - 259.76] needs
  [259.76 - 259.98] to
  [259.98 - 260.14] do
  [260.14 - 260.46] next.

[4:20]  But it's all behind the scenes.
  [260.96 - 261.08] But
  [261.08 - 261.30] it's
  [261.30 - 261.60] all
  [261.60 - 262.16] behind
  [262.16 - 262.56] the
  [262.56 - 262.86] scenes.

[4:23]  So while you only see the interface, what's really happening is that the AI agent is working through a whole process
  [263.36 - 263.54] So
  [263.54 - 263.80] while
  [263.80 - 264.06] you
  [264.06 - 264.40] only
  [264.40 - 264.72] see
  [264.72 - 264.92] the
  [264.92 - 265.36] interface,
  [265.72 - 266.02] what's
  [266.02 - 266.24] really
  [266.24 - 266.64] happening
  [266.64 - 266.96] is
  [266.96 - 267.10] that
  [267.10 - 267.26] the
  [267.26 - 267.54] AI
  [267.54 - 268.06] agent
  [268.06 - 268.32] is
  [268.32 - 268.68] working
  [268.68 - 268.94] through
  [268.94 - 269.18] a
  [269.18 - 269.48] whole
  [269.48 - 270.06] process

[4:30]  to get you the best result.
  [270.06 - 270.64] to
  [270.64 - 270.88] get
  [270.88 - 271.36] you
  [271.36 - 272.04] the
  [272.04 - 272.34] best
  [272.34 - 272.68] result.

[4:33]  Now here's a simple four step illustration of that process.
  [273.02 - 273.10] Now
  [273.10 - 273.62] here's
  [273.62 - 273.74] a
  [273.74 - 274.18] simple
  [274.18 - 274.68] four
  [274.68 - 275.20] step
  [275.20 - 275.80] illustration
  [275.80 - 276.66] of
  [276.66 - 277.04] that
  [277.04 - 277.52] process.

[4:38]  The first is the input.
  [278.10 - 278.22] The
  [278.22 - 278.50] first
  [278.50 - 278.84] is
  [278.84 - 279.06] the
  [279.06 - 279.38] input.

[4:39]  You ask a question or give a command.
  [279.94 - 280.04] You
  [280.04 - 280.46] ask
  [280.46 - 280.64] a
  [280.64 - 281.08] question
  [281.08 - 281.58] or
  [281.58 - 281.84] give
  [281.84 - 282.10] a
  [282.10 - 282.52] command.

[4:43]  The second is processing.
  [283.52 - 283.62] The
  [283.62 - 283.96] second
  [283.96 - 284.28] is
  [284.28 - 284.84] processing.

[4:45]  The AI agent thinks about what you've asked and searches for the best way to respond.
  [285.36 - 285.48] The
  [285.48 - 285.84] AI
  [285.84 - 286.34] agent
  [286.34 - 286.70] thinks
  [286.70 - 287.04] about
  [287.04 - 287.38] what
  [287.38 - 287.70] you've
  [287.70 - 288.00] asked
  [288.00 - 288.32] and
  [288.32 - 288.70] searches
  [288.70 - 288.94] for
  [288.94 - 289.08] the
  [289.08 - 289.40] best
  [289.40 - 289.58] way
  [289.58 - 289.78] to
  [289.78 - 290.12] respond.

[4:51]  Number three is action.
  [291.04 - 291.22] Number
  [291.22 - 291.50] three
  [291.50 - 292.02] is
  [292.02 - 292.42] action.

[4:53]  The AI agent gives you an answer, finds information, or performs a task.
  [293.00 - 293.10] The
  [293.10 - 293.42] AI
  [293.42 - 293.86] agent
  [293.86 - 294.04] gives
  [294.04 - 294.24] you
  [294.24 - 294.42] an
  [294.42 - 294.90] answer,
  [295.54 - 295.76] finds
  [295.76 - 296.44] information,
  [296.68 - 296.86] or
  [296.86 - 297.46] performs
  [297.46 - 297.82] a
  [297.82 - 298.26] task.

[4:58]  And fourth is learning.
  [298.26 - 298.94] And
  [298.94 - 299.24] fourth
  [299.24 - 299.78] is
  [299.78 - 300.16] learning.

[5:00]  The more you use it, the smarter it gets.
  [300.68 - 300.74] The
  [300.74 - 301.04] more
  [301.04 - 301.38] you
  [301.38 - 301.70] use
  [301.70 - 301.90] it,
  [302.04 - 302.22] the
  [302.22 - 302.70] smarter
  [302.70 - 303.06] it
  [303.06 - 303.36] gets.

[5:04]  Learning from past interactions to improve.
  [304.00 - 304.18] Learning
  [304.18 - 304.40] from
  [304.40 - 304.70] past
  [304.70 - 305.42] interactions
  [305.42 - 305.98] to
  [305.98 - 306.34] improve.

[5:07]  So why is it important?
  [307.32 - 307.60] So
  [307.60 - 307.94] why
  [307.94 - 308.14] is
  [308.14 - 308.20] it
  [308.20 - 308.58] important?

[5:09]  AI agents are about to trigger a seismic shift in how we live and work, especially for local businesses and those who support them.
  [309.24 - 309.42] AI
  [309.42 - 309.82] agents
  [309.82 - 310.02] are
  [310.02 - 310.24] about
  [310.24 - 310.40] to
  [310.40 - 310.68] trigger
  [310.68 - 310.92] a
  [310.92 - 311.60] seismic
  [311.60 - 311.92] shift
  [311.92 - 312.22] in
  [312.22 - 312.48] how
  [312.48 - 312.74] we
  [312.74 - 312.96] live
  [312.96 - 313.08] and
  [313.08 - 313.40] work,
  [313.84 - 314.36] especially
  [314.36 - 314.56] for
  [314.56 - 314.80] local
  [314.80 - 315.24] businesses
  [315.24 - 315.82] and
  [315.82 - 316.08] those
  [316.08 - 316.26] who
  [316.26 - 316.60] support
  [316.60 - 316.88] them.

[5:17]  Imagine AI handling routine tasks, freeing business owners to focus on growth and innovation.
  [317.60 - 317.88] Imagine
  [317.88 - 318.26] AI
  [318.26 - 318.74] handling
  [318.74 - 319.20] routine
  [319.20 - 319.68] tasks,
  [320.36 - 320.60] freeing
  [320.60 - 320.88] business
  [320.88 - 321.24] owners
  [321.24 - 321.56] to
  [321.56 - 321.84] focus
  [321.84 - 322.04] on
  [322.04 - 322.30] growth
  [322.30 - 322.84] and
  [322.84 - 323.28] innovation.

[5:23]  For local businesses, this could mean smarter customer service and more efficient operations.
  [323.28 - 324.06] For
  [324.06 - 324.30] local
  [324.30 - 324.80] businesses,
  [325.26 - 325.40] this
  [325.40 - 325.58] could
  [325.58 - 325.82] mean
  [325.82 - 326.58] smarter
  [326.58 - 327.00] customer
  [327.00 - 327.56] service
  [327.56 - 328.04] and
  [328.04 - 328.40] more
  [328.40 - 328.84] efficient
  [328.84 - 329.52] operations.

[5:29]  While agencies and service providers can deliver more value with less effort.
  [329.88 - 330.14] While
  [330.14 - 330.52] agencies
  [330.52 - 331.16] and
  [331.16 - 331.52] service
  [331.52 - 332.08] providers
  [332.08 - 332.56] can
  [332.56 - 332.88] deliver
  [332.88 - 333.22] more
  [333.22 - 333.62] value
  [333.62 - 334.26] with
  [334.26 - 334.54] less
  [334.54 - 334.90] effort.

[5:35]  This isn't just like another tech upgrade.
  [335.60 - 335.88] This
  [335.88 - 336.16] isn't
  [336.16 - 336.36] just
  [336.36 - 336.58] like
  [336.58 - 337.00] another
  [337.00 - 337.32] tech
  [337.32 - 337.80] upgrade.

[5:38]  It's likely the biggest transformation we'll see in our lifetime.
  [338.14 - 338.34] It's
  [338.34 - 338.60] likely
  [338.60 - 338.94] the
  [338.94 - 339.42] biggest
  [339.42 - 340.08] transformation
  [340.08 - 340.64] we'll
  [340.64 - 340.94] see
  [340.94 - 341.32] in
  [341.32 - 341.48] our
  [341.48 - 341.88] lifetime.

[5:42]  Those who embrace AI agents now will have a major advantage.
  [342.36 - 342.54] Those
  [342.54 - 342.84] who
  [342.84 - 343.22] embrace
  [343.22 - 343.48] AI
  [343.48 - 343.98] agents
  [343.98 - 344.48] now
  [344.48 - 344.98] will
  [344.98 - 345.30] have
  [345.30 - 345.60] a
  [345.60 - 346.04] major
  [346.04 - 346.56] advantage.

[5:47]  While those who don't risk being left behind in a rapidly changing world.
  [347.02 - 347.42] While
  [347.42 - 347.64] those
  [347.64 - 347.86] who
  [347.86 - 348.22] don't
  [348.22 - 348.64] risk
  [348.64 - 348.92] being
  [348.92 - 349.12] left
  [349.12 - 349.56] behind
  [349.56 - 349.98] in
  [349.98 - 350.08] a
  [350.08 - 350.40] rapidly
  [350.40 - 350.90] changing
  [350.90 - 351.28] world.

[5:51]  In short, AI agents are set to revolutionize how work gets done.
  [351.28 - 351.82] In
  [351.82 - 352.14] short,
  [352.50 - 352.62] AI
  [352.62 - 353.10] agents
  [353.10 - 353.38] are
  [353.38 - 353.68] set
  [353.68 - 354.06] to
  [354.06 - 355.08] revolutionize
  [355.08 - 355.72] how
  [355.72 - 356.20] work
  [356.20 - 356.54] gets
  [356.54 - 356.82] done.

[5:57]  And the impact will be massive.
  [357.34 - 357.46] And
  [357.46 - 357.58] the
  [357.58 - 357.94] impact
  [357.94 - 358.52] will
  [358.52 - 358.72] be
  [358.72 - 359.12] massive.
